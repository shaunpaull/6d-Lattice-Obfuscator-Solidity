# 6d-Lattice-Obfuscator-Solidity
The LatticeEncryption contract implements a 6-dimensional lattice-based encryption scheme. It generates a large lattice with random symbols and complexities, connects the lattice nodes based on their positions, and provides functions to encrypt and decrypt messages using lattice indices.
